# 1. DA and Visualization by Accenture
*Summary* : An ad-hoc analysis of Social Buzz which is a fast growing social media platform. The clients have a specific request to find the **top 5 category of the platform** along with two other requests related to Data practice and business opportunity.

### Resources 
Three data sets:
**1**.Content.csv
**2**.Reaction.csv
**3**.ReactionTypes.csv

*Content table* comprises of *1000* rows with contentID, ContentType & Category columns.

*Reaction table* consists of *25553* rows of user reaction data.

*ReactionTypes table* contains the *reaction score* of each reaction types(16).

### Steps
1. Cleaned the data of all the tables
2. Created a DataModel for analysis
3. We deduce the Top 5 category of the platform

### Final Insight Summary
Platform has a total of 16 categories and out of which the top5 category analysis revealed that the most engaged content is mostly real life and factual based contents. 

The distribution is quite healthy among all the 16 categories but after analyzing one level deeper into the top5 categories we found that the 1st category is tailing away from other categories which can result into a monotonous experience for the other users of the platform. *Suggested some algorithm adjustment to mantain a healthy ratio of contents among all category.*  
Top5 categories also consists of two food realted contents namely *food* and *healthy-eating* which can be an indication of health concious users on the platform. *Suggested that the platform should do some promotional events or sponsoring the contents related to food and healthy-eating for better user relationship.*
